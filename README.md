This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## WIP - More to come!
This a sandbox project experimenting with Nextjs and XState at it's core

The project utilizes: 
- [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/docs) for styling
- [@xstate/react](https://xstate.js.org/docs/packages/xstate-react/) for a basic state machine

This is currently a work in progress, stay tuned for a blurb on lessoned learned!
